This one gave me a lot of issues. I'm going to have to study a lot more on using databases and sequelize. I tried making this 
from scratch but after the days kept passing by and I would get close but more and more issues would happen. So I decided
to just alter some code on the cats activity to fit my needs. My confidence kind of took a hit but I will keep trying to figure
this out.
